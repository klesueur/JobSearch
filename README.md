# JobSearch

During my job search in the Data Analytic field, I am noticing an emphasis on Excel skills. Before getting into Tech, I thought I was good at Excel. But since then, that has very much changed - The more you learn, the more you realize how very little you know.

Here is my first Excel project - My job search analysis! The goal? To learn formulas, how to use Excel tools to create an analytic dashboard.
